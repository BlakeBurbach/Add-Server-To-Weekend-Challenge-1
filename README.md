- create a static file server
    - npm init creates our package.json
    - get Express
    - git commit 
    - make a file called server.js
    - source in express 
    - setup up a localhost
    - structure the folders for server side and client side
    - transfer files and folders from Weekend Challenge 1 over to our server folder and into public folder
    - start up the server
    - be amazed that you seriously just did that
